# AddressBook1
First Address Book Assignment Adv Java


To set up, download all files into your computer and have Eclipse set up already.

To start program, run the main address book file (AddressBook.java)

The command are pretty straight forward, but they go like this:

1. add a contact to the address book. The program will ask user for all parameters for a contact
2. update contact. Using the search method, user will find contact to update and user will then update the desired parameters
3. delete contact. Using the search method, user will find contact to delete for addressbook and then contact will be deleted
4. search. User will search either by first name, last name, or phone number. Search will return first instance of the parameter, so it will ask if this was the person user was looking for. If it was, the program will continue, otherwise the program will terminate the search / any other method that was implementing the search method.
5. Save address book. This function will save the current addressbook to the text file. Any changes made will be seen the next time the program is ran.
6. List all contact. This option will display the entire address book.
7. Quit. This option safely quits the program and saves data. Quitting any other way can result in loss of progress.
